AutoHotkey No-Recoil Script for Apex Legends

original thread: https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/apex-legends/328576-updated-apex-legends-norecoil-script-2-a.html

I am currently maintaining two versions and testing one:

Narrator Version:
- This version has a tiny man included in the code, he will talk to you anytime you select a new weapon or cycle between them.
You can set his voice speed and volume on section ;VOICE.
- Works in fullscreen

Tooltip Version:
- This version shows a little on-screen box with the name of the weapon you selected.
- Only works on borderless.

Narrator ShortWords Version:
- Same as Narrator Version, but saying 3 instead of r301, 9 for r99, P for Peacekeeper...etc.
- This is mainly to test script speed when cycling weapons. I'll decide later if I'll maintain it or not.



NOTES:
- Don't forget to edit the script and change the sensitivity value to suit your needs.
- If you don't use default game keybinds be sure to check the script's ;HOTKEYS section and edit the keys accordingly.


AHK Hider is recommended to hide ahk scripts, I believe it was made by tgottie.
It's already included in the folder.

Some anti-virus might delete ahk hider dll files.
Your final folder should look like the one here: https://prnt.sc/n59k1e


HOW TO:
1. Run no-recoil script. (Only run one version, either tooltip or narrator)
2. Run ahkhider.ahk
3. Play.
