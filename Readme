Narrator Version:
- This version has a tiny man included in the code, he will talk to you anytime you select a new weapon or cycle between them.
You can set his voice speed and volume on "settings.ini" or by using the included GUI.
- Works in fullscreen
- This is the default selected script.

Know Issues:
- It will sometimes double-speak the name of the weapon. This doesn't have any effect on script functionality. Will fix it later.


Tooltip Version:
- This version shows a little on-screen box with the name of the weapon you selected.
- Only works on borderless.



NOTES:
- Now there's only one script, you can still chose between Narrator or Tooltip by going to Settings.
- If you don't use default game keybinds configure them on Settings.
- The script can still be used without the GUI, all configs are now in setttings.ini. You can manually edit it.

- DPI not yet implemented, even though it shows on GUI.

AHK Hider is recommended to hide ahk scripts, I believe it was made by tgottie.

Some anti-virus might delete ahk hider dll files.
Your final folder should look like the one below.
